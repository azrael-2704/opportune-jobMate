We're building the future of intelligent systems. Join us as an AI/ML Researcher!

What you'll be doing:
- Conduct cutting-edge research in ML, NLP, or CV.
- Prototype and test deep learning models (e.g., BERT, CNNs).
- Collaborate with product teams to deploy research into real systems.

You must have:
- Strong Python & ML toolkit knowledge (PyTorch, TensorFlow, scikit-learn).
- Solid background in linear algebra, statistics, and optimization.
- Experience working with large datasets.

Bonus if:
- You've published in top-tier conferences (NeurIPS, ACL, CVPR).
- You're familiar with distributed training (Horovod, Ray).

This is a hands-on applied research role â€” bring your curiosity!
